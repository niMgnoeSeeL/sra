		gif2png -- GIF to PNG graphics file conversion

The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
to Portable Network Graphics.  It can be built under any Unix, or
under MS-DOS or Windows using djgpp, or using Borland C. I don't know
when the djgpp or Borland builds were last tested.

This distribution also supplies web2png, a Python front end for
gif2png which automagically converts entire web hierarchies (the
graphics files themselves and references to them in web pages).
Note: this script requires Python 1.5.2.

These programs has a home site at <http://www.catb.org/~esr/gif2png/>.
Look there for updates and related resources. 
See NEWS for the project history.
